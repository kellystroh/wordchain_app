    <p> <b>Beware weird phrases:</b> I used NLP tools to extract two-word 
        phrases from 150,000 news articles. I took the most common 100,000 word 
        pairings and removed words with fewer than three 'connecting' words to avoid 
        potential dead ends. The resulting collection includes many phrases that 
        do not qualify as common idioms, and a handful that may be offensive.
        An improved collection is in the works!</p>

<div class="w3-cell-row w3-mobile w3-border-top w3-border-bottom" id="beware" style="padding-left:30mm; padding-right:30mm; padding-top:5mm; padding-bottom:5mm;">
    <h4>About This Game</h4>
    <p> The core idea of this game was inspired by the game show Chain Reaction. On the show, the phrases are always
        "common", two-word idioms in American English. Only rarely have I seen an unfamiliar turn of phrase pop up, so they
        set the bar high. Alas, I have yet to find an extensive database of idioms, let alone two-word idioms. The good news 
        is that this gave me a way to make the project more data-sciencey (in technical terms). The bad news is that my 
        current collection of phrases is bound to disappoint game show connoisseurs, including <b>my mother</b>, who <b>has 
        proclaimed that my "phrases are terrible"</b>. 
        <br><br>
        As for the data science, I built this because I love word games & I enjoy any excuse to do NLP. I have considered 
        scraping online resources, but I wanted to start with the challenge of generating a collection of phrases using 
        NLP tools. When I have finished annotating my work, I will post the GitHub links, where you can find the details of 
        the process. For now, I will just say that it is ongoing. The current batch of phrases is a mix of idioms and pairs of
        words that happen to occur frequently in news stories. 
        <br><br>
        I also wanted to practice deploying a flask app that has more interactive functionality than my website. 
        I am not a web developer, so this will not be the ideal example of best practices in web apps. That said, it has 
        led me to explore lots of free resources, so I will eventually write out some tips for fellow beginners. </p>

<h4>Upgrades in Progress</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Improved Collection of Phrases (including a fix to faulty lemmatization)</li>
    <li><strike>Better web formatting.</strike> I'd like to make a How-To guide<strike>, but I'm too embarassed
        to share shoddy HTML files.</strike> I am no longer embarassed of my HTML files, though they'll only feature
        in the How-To guide to demonstrate the Flask components </li>
    <li>GitHub links. I'm working to make it easier to navigate before sharing. </li>
    <li>Change Scoring method. It seemed fair to award fewer points for guessing the word "book" 
        if the preview is "boo" than if the preview is "b". However, the current formula could
        unfairly disadvantage a player for getting shorter words. 
    </li>
    <li>Enable phrase feedback. Building a tool allowing users to mark phrases 
        that should be removed from the collection. I'd like an easy path to remove
        phrases that users deem inappropriate or offensive. The pairing process takes
        out of their intended context, and news stories can cover sensitive topics.</li>
    <li>Game stats. My latest improvement added a new table to collect data on words used, 
        answers given, and number of guesses before answering correctly. I'd like to publish
        random facts, like which words appear most often and which words are hardest to guess </li>
